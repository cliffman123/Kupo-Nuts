# Deploying with Vercel or Netlify

## Why it's better than GitHub Pages + ngrok:
- Hosts both frontend and backend in one platform
- Automatic HTTPS, no CORS issues
- Free tier available
- Continuous deployment from GitHub

## Setup instructions:

### 1. For Vercel:
- Create `api` folder in your project root for serverless functions
- Move your server endpoints to individual files in this folder

Example file structure:
```
/my-react-app
  /src
    /components
    App.js
    config.js
  /api
    videos.js  (your endpoints as serverless functions)
```

### 2. For Netlify:
- Create `netlify/functions` folder
- Move your endpoints to serverless functions

Either option will deploy both your frontend and API together, eliminating CORS concerns.
